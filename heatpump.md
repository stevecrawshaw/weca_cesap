Based on the research conducted using arXiv, PubMed, and web browsing tools, here are the findings regarding the payback time for air source heat pumps in the UK for domestic properties, considering the UK government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme:

1. **Boiler Upgrade Scheme Overview**:
   - The Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) in the UK offers grants to support the installation of heat pumps and biomass boilers in homes and non-domestic buildings in England and Wales【17†source】.
   - As of 23 October 2023, the grant level for air source heat pumps (ASHPs) and ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) increased from £5,000 and £6,000 respectively to £7,500【16†source】【18†source】.

2. **Eligibility and Application**:
   - Eligibility for the BUS includes homeowners and small business property owners in England and Wales. Applicants must own the property, have a valid Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), and the property should have an installation capacity up to 45kWth【18†source】.
   - The scheme aims to assist homes primarily in low Energy Performance Certificate bands D to G to improve their EPC rating【19†source】.

3. **Benefits and Savings**:
   - Air source heat pumps are noted for their high efficiency, often exceeding 300%, and can provide heating and domestic hot water【19†source】.
   - Potential annual savings for a typical three-bedroom semi-detached home are substantial when switching to an air source heat pump from older heating systems. For instance, savings from replacing an old G-rated gas boiler can be around £295 annually, and replacing an old electric storage heater can save approximately £1,100 per year【19†source】.

4. **Payback Time Considerations**:
   - The return on investment for replacing oil and LPG heating systems with air source heat pumps can be as little as five years, depending on various factors like the age of the current heating system and home size【19†source】.
   - The specific payback time for each household will vary based on the initial cost of the heat pump, the amount of the grant received, the previous heating system being replaced, and the home's energy efficiency improvements.

5. **Limitations of the Research**:
   - The research did not uncover specific academic studies or reports that provide a standardized payback period for air source heat pumps in the UK including the Boiler Upgrade Scheme. This is likely due to the variability of individual circumstances and the recent changes in the scheme.

6. **Recommendations for Further Inquiry**:
   - Homeowners considering the switch to an air source heat pump should consult with MCS certified installers to get personalized estimates of costs, savings, and payback time based on their specific situations.
   - It's also advisable to stay updated with any further changes to the Boiler Upgrade Scheme or other relevant incentives.

For a more detailed understanding and personalized assessment, it's recommended to consult directly with energy efficiency experts or certified installers who can provide specific insights based on individual property assessments.
